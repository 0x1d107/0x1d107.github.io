		<description><![CDATA[<h1 id="new-blog">New blog</h1>

<p>Hi. This is my new blog. Again. Here I&#8217;ll post some how-to&#8217;s and description of my projects.
Probably. I hope won&#8217;t abandon it again. </p>

<h2 id="microblog">Microblog</h2>

<p>If you want to read shorter chaotic twitter-like posts, you can also follow my rss-only feed:
<a href="http://0x1d107.xyz/txtlog/0x1d107.xml">http:&#47;&#47;0x1d107.xyz&#47;txtlog&#47;0x1d107.xml</a>. Here I share the links to projects of my interest and other
stuff. warning: contains swearing and russian language.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-blog-generator">About the blog generator</h2>

<p>The main part of the blog generator is just a makefile. Make tracks files that changed and generates
the repective html output. For markdown to html conversion I use
<a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/">lowdown</a> translator. As for the two &#8220;dynamic&#8221; files, <code>index.html</code>
and the rss feed, they are generated using shell scripts with here-docs as templates. I think it
works well enough for this case and it doesn&#8217;t require a whole macro processor, like m4 or php.</p>

<p>Later, I&#8217;ll add formula convertion from LaTeX to MathML at the generation stage. For now, something
like <a href="https://temml.org/index.html">Temml</a> would do the job client-side.</p>]]></description>
